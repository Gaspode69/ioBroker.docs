## Bosch / Buderus heating systems with km200 / IP-inside and/or ems-esp interface 

The adapter supports an interface towards the heating systems from Bosch Group using EMS or EMS+ bus. 
(Buderus / Junkers / Netfit etc). 

## It can interface towards the heating system with use of Web-API calls toward:

* km200, km200 hrv, km100, km50, HMC300 or IP-inside (from Bosch Group) 

* ems-esp gateway (https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32) with the ESP32 chip. 
  The old ESP8266 gateways with API V2 are not supported anymore !!
  The adapter is tested for the ems-esp gateway with latest stable firmware version (V3.6.5)
  Latest dev versions of firmware might not work stable with the ioBroker adapter. Use is on own risk.

* New Bosch-Group Cloud-Gateways (MX300 / EasyControl ...) are not supported since they do not support LAN API !

The ioBroker ems-esp adapter can read and write data to both gateways to control all heating components. 
It can be used either for the original Bosch-Group gateways or the ems-esp or both in parallel.
All changed states from own scripts or the object browser does have to set acknowledged = false !!!

## NEW in Version >= 3.3.0: Intoduce warnings for using non-productive ems-esp firmware.
