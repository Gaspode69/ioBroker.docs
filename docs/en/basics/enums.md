# Categories/Lists
Category definitions play an important role in ioBroker.
They help to group and sort the objects in the visualization.

A category is the list of objects that are grouped together, e.g. all devices in a room or all devices of type "lighting".

From the start there are two categories: `RÃ¤ume` and `Funktionen`. However, you can also define your own categories.

## What are the categories used for?
- **Visualization**: The categories help to group and sort the objects in the visualization.
- **Logic**: Categories can be used in scripts to perform certain actions on all objects in a category.
- **Scenes**: The categories can be used in scenes.
