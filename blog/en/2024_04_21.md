Initially targeted at the Senec Home V2.1 System. In the Senec.Home system, only selected values can be changed by the adapter. Senec currently also no longer provides a reliable way to influence peak shaving via the web interface. Whether other systems (e.g. V3) also work with it depends on whether they are also based on lala.cgi and provide the same JSON information.

## energiefluss-erweitert (11.3.2024) – new adapter

Homekit Tiles is a widget set based on the design of Apple HomeKit.

The design is adjusted by changing the CSS code. For this purpose, the CSS code from the file /widgets/homekittiles/css/style.css can be used as a template.
The code is inserted into the CSS tab in the VIS editor and can be customized as desired.
It is also possible to add your own CSS classes via the VIS editor in the "General" section of the widgets.

The widgets are designed for VIS 1.x.

## scheduler (05.4.2024) – new feature
