# May 2024:  New Adapters and Enhancements in ioBroker

Hello, ioBroker community! As we wrap up another eventful month, we're excited to share several significant updates and new features that have rolled out in May 2024. 
From sophisticated adapters to crucial software updates, let’s dive into what’s new and noteworthy in the ioBroker 

## New adapter

The ioBroker PID Adapter introduces the functionality of a **PID controller**, which is a sophisticated tool for system regulation. 
Essentially, a PID controller continuously adjusts a control variable to bring a system's actual value closer to a desired setpoint. 
It does so through a calculated correction based on three parameters: **Proportional** (P), **Integral** (I), and **Derivative** (D).

A common real-world application of this is a car's cruise control, which adjusts the vehicle's power output to maintain a set speed despite changes in road incline. 
Similarly, the PID controller in this adapter minimizes delays and overshoots in system responses, ensuring efficient operation.

This adapter allows the configuration of multiple controllers within a single instance. 
Users can set and adjust the P, I, and D parameters, as well as the cycle time for calculations. 

Additional features include the ability to pause and resume calculations, reset the controller, and a manual mode that lets users directly set the output. 

The output itself can be confined within minimum and maximum values and adjusted by a fixed offset for precision.

For diagnostic purposes, all essential data, including internal states, are accessible within the adapter, providing a comprehensive overview of the controller’s performance.

Developer's Note: 
This adapter owes its existence to the excellent foundational work done by @Philmod, who developed the node-pid-controller. 
You can find this invaluable resource on GitHub: node-pid-controller. 
Our implementation builds upon his robust framework, enabling us to bring PID control capabilities to the ioBroker environment.

## unifi-protect (28.4.2024) Developer: Peter Baumert and iobroker-community-adapters

This adapter connects to the **UniFi Protect Controller** and retrieves data from all added cameras. It enables you to set up, configure, and monitor your **UniFi video cameras**. 

The default ports are as follows, unless you have modified them:

Cloud Key Plus Gen2: 7443
UDM Pro: 443

## air-q (1.5.2024) Developer: CorantGmbH

<img src="https://github.com/CorantGmbH/ioBroker.air-q/blob/main/admin/air-q.png" width="100" height="100" />

This ioBroker adapter is designed to work with the **air-Q** device from Corant GmbH. 

The air-Q is renowned as one of the most advanced and powerful **air quality monitors** available. 
It assesses air quality and detects fine dust, carbon monoxide, chemicals, and other pollutants. 

The adapter regularly retrieves data from the device's sensors and displays these readings within the ioBroker environment.

You can see the device in action in a live demonstration video on YouTube, which highlights features including how the air-Q can serve as a smart smoke detector.
