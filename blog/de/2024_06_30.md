Notification integration for IoBroker includes support for Notifications for Android TV and Notifications for Fire TV. With this integration, you can send notifications to your Android TV device. It enables an overlay displaying the message content for a customizable duration before disappearing. Additionally, it supports sending images, such as those from security cameras, and custom icons. Icons function similarly to images, appearing smaller and to the left of the notification, while images display larger and above the notification.

These notifications operate within the global scope of your Android TV device, appearing regardless of the active application.
